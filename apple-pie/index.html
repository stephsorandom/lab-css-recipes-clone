    <ol><h4>Directions</h4> 
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
      to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. </li>
    <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
      slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
      that it does not run off.</li> 
    <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
